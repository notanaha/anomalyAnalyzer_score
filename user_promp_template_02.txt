You have six time-series datasets with multiple variables indicating anomalies.
The following list indicates the file path and its anomaly type with the format of [(<path to a file>, <anomaly type>), ...].
anomaly_files = [
    ("filename", "label"),
    ..........
]

You are helping to determine which anomaly type a given test file belongs to.
The path of the "test_file" is "./data/test_data.csv".
